# Univaersal Wallet  Work Item

Device Binding is a building block for the wallet security that enables a high level in the differential credential security model by anchoring a hardware-generated public key to the credential. This hardware-generated key might originate from TEE, SecureEnclave, Secure Elements or TPMs. Device binding is always to be understood as an optional feature for improved wallet security. Device binding is intended to fulfill higher requirements for regulated use cases.
