# Differential Credential Security
Differential Credential Security is a core feature of wallet security. Wallet implementers can choose to support multiple security levels (or maintain a singular, global security concept) for the wallet and all the contained credentials. This feature addresses the security requirements of individual issuers/verifiers from different domains and industries, e.g. regulated vs non-regulated use cases, low & high security. Security capabilities are communicated in profiles matching level of assurances.
